# Team 2: The Masters

## Bot name: Stinger

### Our Bot Goal:
* High speed: We want to work with a functional transmission that shifts gears based on speed and power output. Using custom parts and a fabricated shell for aerodynamics.
### Our Mechanical design and ideas for the bot:
* Double '|' style chassis
* High gear count transmission (4+ gears)
* High power motor
* Citroën Hydropneumatic Suspension
* Reactive weight to counteract large bumps

* ### Cole:
* Group leader: Oversees the entire team and ensures that all tasks are on track.
Facilitates communication between team members, mentors, and coaches.
* Programmer: Writes and tests the code that controls the robot. Works closely with the electrical and mechanical teams to ensure the code works with the hardware.
* Electrical Engineer: Manages wiring, sensors, and power distribution.
* ### Miles:
* Mechanical Engineer: Designs and assembles the robot’s mechanical systems.
* CAD specialist: Creates detailed computer-aided design (CAD) models of the robot.
Collaborates with mechanical engineers to develop accurate and functional designs.
* Driver: Operates the robot during competitions.
Practices regularly to improve skill and coordination.
* ### Gage:
* Mechanical Engineer: Ensures that the robot meets size, weight, and functional requirements.
Collaborates with the CAD designer to turn designs into reality.
* Social Media guy: Ensures that the robot meets size, weight, and functional requirements.
Collaborates with the CAD designer to turn designs into reality.
* Documentation Specialist: Keeps detailed records of the design process, decisions, and progress.
* ### Obie:
* Mechanical Engineer: Designs and builds the robot’s physical structure.
Works on the drivetrain, chassis, and any mechanical systems (e.g., arms, lifts, grippers).
* Electrical Engineer: Ensures that the electrical components work correctly with the mechanical parts.
Troubleshoots electrical issues during testing.
* Strategist: Develops the overall competition strategy.
Analyzes the game rules and scoring to maximize points.
